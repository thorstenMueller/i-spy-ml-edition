# i-spy-ml-edition (machine learning edition)
This repo is currently just a collection of ideas on doing machine learning for a very famous game for kids.
> "i spy with my little eye" or as it's called in german "Ich sehe was, was du nicht siehst"

For those who never were kids ;-)
One child chooses an object within sight and names its color. Other kids or adults have to name objects with matching color and the kid who has chosen an object has to tell weather it is the object or it's not.

# Okay, what machine learning for
This game could involve lots of ml stuff
* stt (speech recognition)
* nlu (natural language understanding)
* object recognition
* color recognition
* tts (text to speech)
* recognition of pointing direction of hands (point on an object)

# How could it be
* ml: Look for an object and name it's color.
* human: I spy with my little eye, something "green"
* ml: You mean the carpet?
* human: no
* ml: You mean the picture on the wall?
* human: You mean THIS picture (points to one picture on the wall).
* ml: No, the other picture
* human: This picture? Points to another picture on the wall.
* ml: Yes
* human: No, that's not the object i meant
* ml: You mean the flower?
* human: Yes, that's the right object

# TODO
* [x] getting the idea
* [ ] everything else ;-)
