# i-spy-ml-edition
This repo is currently just a collection of ideas on doing machine learning for a very famous game for kids.
> "i spy with my little eye" or as it's called in german "Ich sehe was, was du nicht siehst"

For those who never were kids ;-)
One child chooses an object within sight and names its color. Other kids or adults have to name objects with matching color and the kid who has chosen an object has to tell weather it is the object or it's not.

# Okay, what machine learning for
This game could involve lots of ml stuff
* stt (speech recognition)
* nlu (natural language understanding)
* object recognition
* color recognition
* tts (text to speech)
